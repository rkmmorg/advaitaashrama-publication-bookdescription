This Upanishad belongs to the Yajur Veda and is very popular among those who learn Vedic chanting in the strictly traditional manner. It reveals to the readers in a flash with aphoristic brevity the quintessence of the entire philosophy of the Upanishads. Readers are also presented with a gradation of higher and higher bliss towards the end of the book. In it are also found the different layers of human personality constituted of the five sheaths and it undertakes a thorough investigation into it which finally culminates in the climactic experience of discovering the innermost Self. With a lucid and faithful translation of the main text and the commentary of Sri Shankaracharya with relevant notes the value of this book for any student of Vedanta need not be explicitly stated.
