Among the many biographies of Swami Vivekananda, the present book has a place of special importance, as it is a historical review of the great life and contribution of the great Swami by one whose scrutiny of facts, analysis of events, and unbiased search for truth won him a place of honour among the eminent historians of the twentieth century. The author has deliberately avoided discussions on mystic experiences and philosophical ideas of the Swami and has portrayed him purely on historical lines.
