This book narrates the story of the Ramakrishna Mission. At the dawn of the third Millennium, the Ramakrishna Mission reviews the story of its 109 years of loving service to humanity, or, in the words of Swami Vivekananda, service to that God who by the ignorant is called man. The book is divided into four parts under the titles: Sources of Inspiration, Historical Perspectives, Contributions of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, and Ideological Perspectives.
