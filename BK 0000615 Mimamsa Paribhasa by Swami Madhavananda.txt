Purva Mimamsa is one of the six systems of Indian Philosophy. This book is the smallest popular treatise on the subject. Culled from the Jaimini Sutras it sets forth some of the salient ritualistic principles of this thought system and is hence a veritable boon for the beginners. This book contains the original text in Devanagari and a literal and yet faithful translation along with copious notes.
