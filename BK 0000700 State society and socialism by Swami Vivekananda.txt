This is a compilation from the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. In the present confusion of thought and miserable plight through which people are passing, Swami Vivekananda's life-giving ideas on many of the burning socio-political problems that assail us today shed new light on the topic and show us a more suitable way to their solutions, thereby helping to establish a better world where people of all nations may live in peace and amity.
