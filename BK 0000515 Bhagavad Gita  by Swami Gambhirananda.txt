Though there are many classical commentaries on the Gita, this work stands next only to Sri Shankaracharya's commentary as regards clarity, depth, and originality. This work of Madhusudana Saraswati, the Gudhartha Dipika (an annotation revealing the true import of the Gita) is probably the greatest of his many literary works. It is a valuable addition to our publication and is highly recommended to serious students of Indian philosophy and religion.
