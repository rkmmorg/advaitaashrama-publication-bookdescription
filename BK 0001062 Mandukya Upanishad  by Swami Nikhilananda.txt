According to Shankaracharya this Upanishad contains the quintessence of all the Upanishads. This volume contains the text of the Upanishad and Gaudapada's Karika in Devanagari their translation and also the translation of Shankaracharya's commentaries on them along with exhaustive notes. A critical and scholarly preface by the learned translator adds to the worth of the book.It is difficult to imagine how the abstruse subject matter of this Upanishad and Shankaracharya's commentary could be made more easy of comprehension.
