This book is a collection of six lectures culled from the first volume of the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. As the title suggests, it chiefly deals with the Vedanta philosophy and its different aspects, including Vedanta as a factor in civilization, influence of Vedanta, place of privilege in this philosophy, and the different steps in the march towards the highest Vedantic vision. An important book for all the students of Vedanta eager to learn the different implications and aspects of this philosophy in brief.
