The greatest teachers of mankind have mostly given their profoundest thoughts in the simplest form of parables. Their teachings were often expressed in tales and parables. Sri Ramakrishna is no exception. Only he added wit and humour to his homely tales and parables. Simple though the parables are, they illustrate the all-comprehensive message of the great Master. In this book especially meant for children the readers will find some of the most interesting and significant teachings of Sri Ramakrishna in the form of parables collected and presented pictorially.

At the Exhibition held at Belur Math in connection with the Convention of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in 1980 some of these parables and illustrations of Sri Ramakrishna were depicted through clay-models a traditional art of rural-Bengal produced by Sri Lakshmi Kanta Pal. 32 pictures in colour printed from the photographs of these models form the present book.

The book has 32 parables (with pictures) like:

	God provides for everyone
	Take care of your Heart
	The Giver is the Lord Himself
	The Kite and the Crows
	The Woman husking pady
	The Real Guru
	Fencing the young plant
	... Etc.
