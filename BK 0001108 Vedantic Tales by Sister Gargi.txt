The author of this book presents a sextet of lighter vein in these six Vedantic Tales. Most Hindus will be familiar with the parables upon which these tales are based having heard them since their early childhood. But these are not children's tales. Parables are not and never were meant for children; they bring message from the realm of the spirit to the adult particularly to the grown-up adult with ears to hear. Their simplicity is not childish; it is rather the simplicity of an arrow pointed and swift and fashioned to strike its mark without ado. Lucidly presented this book will make for an interesting and illuminating reading for both the young and the old alike.
