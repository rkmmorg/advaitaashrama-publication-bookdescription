In these days of terrible erosion in human values, when man is guided by the deadly materialistic view of himself and the world, the role of this book is like that of a beacon light which awakens him to a new value system. Jesus had said, 'love thy neighbours as thyself', but why? In these pages the readers get the answer to this question. The practice of ethics and morality when based merely on religious precepts leaves the modern man with the seed of doubt in his heart as he fails to understand the rationality, behind them. Ethic needs to be founded on the rock of rationality which alone can help the modern man to make it a part of his life whole heartedly. This wonderful collection from the Works of Swami Vivekananda precisely fulfils this role.
