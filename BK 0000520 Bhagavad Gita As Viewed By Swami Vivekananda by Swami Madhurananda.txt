Book Review:
Swami Vivekananda's views on the Gita are scattered throughout The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda published by us in nine volumes. To Swarniji's keen intellect, the shastras would open up and reveal a hitherto unheard meaning that appealed to one and all. The present book is a compilation of all the Swami's views classified according to the chapters and verses of the Gita. In consequence, the reader is taken through some of the verses of the Gita along with the Swami's commentary, as it were.
