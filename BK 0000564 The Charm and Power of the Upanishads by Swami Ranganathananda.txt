'Let the lion of Vedanta roar and the foxes (of fear and hatred) will fly to their holes' said Swami Vivekananda. It is that lion roar which we get in the Upanishads. And it is precisely this truth that the author of this book tries to uncover and present to the readers. He brilliantly succeeds in bringing out the tremendous potency of the Upanishads in playing the role of a torchbearer illuminating the dark labyrinths of human life and destiny.
