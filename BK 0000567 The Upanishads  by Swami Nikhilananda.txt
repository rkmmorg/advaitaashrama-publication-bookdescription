Although the Upanishads are by far the oldest outpourings of the mystical consciousness of man they have remained unequalled by any rival ancient or modern in profundity splendour and purity. Though historically the products of India and of a particular age they are in essence ageless and universal. This abridged edition contains excerpts from the Katha Isha Kena Mundaka Shvetashvatara Prashna Mandukya Aitareya Brihadaranyaka Taittiriya and Chandogya Upanishads. The translation is faithful and graceful and the exposition authentic instructive and attractive.
