This book comprising of two brilliant lectures shows the intrinsic harmony between science's spirit of critical inquiry into the external nature and Vedanta's quest for the Eternal within. The author supports his view by quoting scientists like Einstein Eddington Capra and others and also from the Hindu scriptures. He successfully points out the way towards the attainment of a synthesis of thought in these two apparently divergent streams of human enquiry so greatly needed by man today.
