Kali the Mother is a collection of excellent essays on the Divine Mother of the Universe written from an intensely personal point of view blended with an extraordinary metaphysical insight into the cosmic aspect of the Kali Ideal. No one who wants to understand the traditional Indian worship of the Terrible in nature as an aspect of God can afford to miss a perusal of this brilliant study. This was the first book of Sister Nivedita.
