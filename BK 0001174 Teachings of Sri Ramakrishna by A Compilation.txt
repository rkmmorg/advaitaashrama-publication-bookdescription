The phenomenon called Sri Ramakrishna was the other name for God-consciousness. Like bread soaked in sugar syrup he was one who was permeated out-and-out with God-consciousness. Obviously, it's no wonder that his teachings should cover the entire gamut of spiritual and religious life. This book is a classified and comprehensive collection of his wonderful sayings and parables. Needless to say, this book will be vade mecum for all those who are religious minded and are engaged in spiritual practices eager to have communion with God.
