This is a small treatise on the Advaita philosophy by Sri Shankaracharya with the Vartika of Sureshwaracharya. Characterized by extreme brevity of expression on the one hand and marvellous sublimity of thought on the other this work contains the quintessence of the Upanishads. It presents the theoretical aspect of the one Reality along with the practical way of realizing one's identity with It in samadhi through the symbol OM. With a lucid translation an informative introduction notes and a glossary this book will be of great value to all students of Vedanta.
