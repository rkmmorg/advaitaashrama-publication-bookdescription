This book gives the reader an overview of the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893. Also presented here are some of the speeches of the delegates which reflect the myriad rays of human thought emanating from the different religions of the world. Needless to say, special stress has been laid on Swami Vivekananda's participation in the Parliament and his stupendous success which paved the way for a greater harmony between followers of all the religions of the world.
