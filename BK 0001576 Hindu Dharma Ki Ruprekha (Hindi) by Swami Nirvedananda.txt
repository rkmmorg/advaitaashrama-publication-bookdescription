Hinduism, resting on numerous and varied scriptural texts obviously requires an encyclopaedic treatment. This book aims to give a broad outline of the prominent features of this religion. It aims at acquainting the busy reader with all that Hinduism stands for, and that as quickly as possible. The author succeeds admirably in giving a clear and precise account of the fundamental categories of Hindu thought in a very interesting manner.
