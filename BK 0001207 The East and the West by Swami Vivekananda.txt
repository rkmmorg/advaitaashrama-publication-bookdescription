In this book the author paints on a vast canvas the salient features of the Oriental and Occidental civilizations and shows that every nation is an expression of an idea; that every nation has got a distinctive role to play as far as the preservation and strengthening of the world order is concerned; that there ought to be swapping of these ideas with an open mind to make for a healthy world order.

The author, in his inimitable style, and at times in a humorous and sarcastic vein, brings out the different colourful traits of both the Orientals and the Occidentals, which not only keep the readers engrossed, but also rouses in them a sense of respect and honour for all the civilizations of the world.
