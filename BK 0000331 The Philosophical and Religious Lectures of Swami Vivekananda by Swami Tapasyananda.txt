Unlike the western tradition, in India, philosophy and religion have always gone hand-in-hand. This has helped the seekers after Truth to move ahead on their path without being complacent with merely an intellectual assent to the existence of the highest Reality or a Supreme Being, God. This book is precisely meant for all the aspirants to help them overcome not only their obstacles to a proper intellectual grasp of the Reality, but also to make them move in that direction of the Supreme Beatitude.
