This wonderful book comprising some of the most illuminating articles by the author makes the reader feel the joy of mystical experience emerging from them. They assure us that seeing God everywhere is possible. They tell us that one day we shall have this experience. In a very practical way we are shown how we can begin to make this experience a reality in our own lives. To say that it is worth reading doesn't begin to do justice to the book.
