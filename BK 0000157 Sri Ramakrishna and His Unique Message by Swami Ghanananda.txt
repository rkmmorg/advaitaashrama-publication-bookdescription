This book is an attempt to elucidate the unique message of Sri Ramakrishna in all its aspects, indicate its significance and its place in Indian religious literature, and suggest ways and means for its practical application. And in showing how he gained his priceless spiritual treasures, the book also briefly tells the story of his soul's journey through sea after sea of the shoreless and uncharted deep in search of all its pearls, which he later threaded into the most beautiful rosary.
