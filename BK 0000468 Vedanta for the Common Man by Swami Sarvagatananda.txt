The present compilation helps the reader envisage the perfect relationship between the most ancient Vedanta Truths and the later developed religious thoughts and bases them on the same principle of Oneness which naturally harmonizes the different religions and transcends belief systems. The realization of these Truths came out of the silent meditations of the past sages. This work efficiently reflects these shafts of light thrown out in the brilliant talks on Vedanta by Revered Swami Sarvagatanandaji.
