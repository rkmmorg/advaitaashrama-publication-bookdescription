This Upanishad is contained in the Rig Veda and forms a part of the Aitareya Aranyaka. With Sanskrit verses and its English rendering followed by an authentic translation of Sri Shankaracharya's commentary this Upanishad distinctly expounds the goal of human life to be the realization of the identity of the individual soul and the Supreme Soul.
