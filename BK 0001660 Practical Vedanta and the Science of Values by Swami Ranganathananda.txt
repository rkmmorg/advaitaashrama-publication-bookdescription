The problem of value erosion is an international issue today. With the advancement of modern science and critical enquiry moral values have lost their hold on millions of people especially under the force of the philosophy of materialism upheld by many scientists. Against this dark scenario this book presents an answer to this problem through its philosophy of Vedanta which proclaims that the science of values is a link between the physical sciences and the science of spirituality. The author's brilliant exposition of the subject is not only convincing but also highly inspiring.
