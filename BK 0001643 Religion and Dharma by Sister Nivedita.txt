This book comprises the essays written by Sister Nivedita in the early years of the twentieth century to uplift and arouse the young men and women of India so that they can fulfil the great destiny which the author saw was awaiting them in the days ahead. Some of these essays will seem prophetic to present-day readers. As they deal mainly with the general principles of individual and social growth they have a great value for India in her present state when she has entered the third millennium with the conscious awareness of the great role she ought to play in the present world scenario marred by religio-political conflicts and tension.
