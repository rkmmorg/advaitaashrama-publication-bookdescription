The book is the biography of Swami Ashokananda, a disciple of Swami Vivekananda, an eminent monk of the Ramakrishna Order

This beautifully produced book is a labour of love. Sister Gargi (Marie Louise Burke), well known for her works on Swami Vivekananda, was initiated by and served Swami Ashokananda for the last years of his life. It tells the story of an extraordinary life of dedication, wholehearted and complete dedication to the mission started by Swami Vivekananda on behalf of Sri Ramakrishna. Highly readable and deeply inspiring.
