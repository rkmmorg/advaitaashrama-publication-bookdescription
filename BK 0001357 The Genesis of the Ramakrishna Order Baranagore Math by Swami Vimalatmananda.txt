<strong>The Genesis of the Ramakrishna Order</strong>

The Baranagore Math is the first Math of the Ramakrishna Order. Soon after the Mahasamadhi of Sri Ramakrishna)8 at Cossi¬pore, it was here that the first Math was given a concrete form. It was here again that Swamiji and his brother disciples performed the formal Viraja Homa to take the vow of Sannyasa and thus gave 811'8ctual shape to the resolutions made at Antpur. Their intense austerities, severe Sadhana and deep scriptural studies undertaken in the Baranagore monastery for man illuminating chapter in the history of the Order. Their love for. one another that grew here forged an incomparable bond of brotherhood. They girded up their loins here for the great Seva- Vajns that was to evolve. They were the innovators of ritualistic worship and religious festivals observed in our centres today. The tradition set by them is being followed to this day at the Belur Math.
