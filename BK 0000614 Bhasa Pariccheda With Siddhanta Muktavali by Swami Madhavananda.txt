This is an important manual on the Nyaya-Vaisheshika philosophy which is extensively read throughout India by all those who want to get a fair knowledge of the subject within a short compass. The book contains the original text along with the author's own gloss called the Siddhantamuktavali and an English translation of both. An effort has been made to make the translation as literal as possible without being unintelligible. Copious notes have been added to elucidate difficult passages. References have been given to most quotations.
