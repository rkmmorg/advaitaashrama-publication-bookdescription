This book consists of eight lectures delivered in America by the author. They give a comprehensive view of the history theory and practice of Vedanta. Speaking to the minds as well as to the hearts of his listeners the Swami dwells in each lecture upon one aspect of Vedanta. The book as a whole therefore will not only provide the student with an intellectual grasp of the Vedanta philosophy and religion but will also help the spiritual aspirant along whatever path or yoga he or she may be following.
