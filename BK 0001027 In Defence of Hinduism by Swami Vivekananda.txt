When the phenomenal success of Swami Vivekananda as a defender of Hindu faith in the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago in 1893 was known in India several meetings were held and addresses of thanks and congratulations were forwarded to him. It was to the addresses of the Hindus of Madras that he wrote his first reply but that was a clarion call to all who were interested in Hinduism or the welfare of India. In this booklet is embodied that famous reply.
