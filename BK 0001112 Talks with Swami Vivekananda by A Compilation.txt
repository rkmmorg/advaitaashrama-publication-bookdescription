Swami Vivekananda has revealed himself with even greater appeal in his intimate and informal conversations with his disciples than in his preaching in public. In these talks, he gives directions about spiritual practice and meditation, talks of high philosophy, and in the next breath discusses the problems of national regeneration, social reform, educational ideals, and other such topics.
