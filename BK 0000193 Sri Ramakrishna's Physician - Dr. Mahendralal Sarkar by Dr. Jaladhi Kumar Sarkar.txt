In the latter part of Ramakrishna's life, the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna makes frequent mention of his physician, Dr. Sarkar. During his time, Dr. Sarkar was highly regarded for his physician skills. He started off as an allopathic doctor and later switched to Homeopathy. He came to Ramakrishna fully trained in western science and philosophy. He had no patience with idolatry or the idea that God could assume a human form. Now for the first time in English, we can read about the doctor who cared for Ramakrishna in his final years.
