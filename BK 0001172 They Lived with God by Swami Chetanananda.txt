The lay disciples of Sri Ramakrishna came from all walks of life attracted by the power and depth of his spirituality. Needless to say, their lives had been transformed by meeting a man whom they came to accept as a Divine Incarnation. In this book the author brings alive the lives of Sri Ramakrishna's twenty-eight principal lay disciples, and shows how they exemplified various facets of their Master's teachings. Above all, this book presents a more complete picture of the Great Master himself, including many new incidents from his life hitherto unrecorded in English.
