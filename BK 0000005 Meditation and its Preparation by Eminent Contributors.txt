Meditation without necessary preparation sometimes leads to frustration and loss of faith for beginners in this grand science of the inner life. Against this background this book provides the readers with a collection of selected essays dealing with different aspects of meditation and other topics related to the life devoted to it. Though these essays do not exhaust all the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject they will certainly prove to be illuminating and extremely useful for all beginners on this path.
