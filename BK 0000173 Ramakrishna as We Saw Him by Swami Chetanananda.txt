The devotees and admirers of Sri Ramakrishna who would like to know more about his daily life and as to how he was seen by his relatives and friends, people of other faiths, leaders of contemporary society, and by the common people of his time, will find this book to be of great value. It is an impressive collection of accounts and reminiscences of Sri Ramakrishna by his disciples, relatives, friends, and acquaintances. They have described, often in intimate detail, some of the lesser-known aspects of Sri Ramakrishna's God-intoxicated life. This book will bring the reader closer to one who has been aptly described as a great spiritual phenomenon of our time.
