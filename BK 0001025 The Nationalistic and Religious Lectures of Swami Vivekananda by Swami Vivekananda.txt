In India, a large number of people are drawn to Swamiji because of his great love for his country. He is called a 'patriot saint'. To them he was more an awakener of India than an awakener of souls. But many devotees and followers of Swamiji the world over are drawn to him because of his spiritual message of strength, hope, and courage which opens up new vistas to them. This book satisfies the needs of both the patriots and the devotees. These great orations of the Swami should form a subject of serious study for all Indians to recapture the spiritual values that we are fast forgetting on account of the rising tide of materialism.
