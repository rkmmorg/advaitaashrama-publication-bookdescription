When an absent brother comes home for a while, his brothers and sisters are happy; and when he goes away again, they are sad. Through the pages of this book, Swami Vivekananda, who is a big brother to all of us, comes home never to go away. He stays on in every home as the guiding light. With him as our companion we grow in strength, goodness, and wisdom in a spontaneous way. What more, he is such fun! This book narrates the ethically and spiritually enlightening life of Swamiji through text and beautiful illustrations.
