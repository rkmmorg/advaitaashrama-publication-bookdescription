The Avadhuta Gita or the song of a liberated soul is a text of Vedanta representing extreme Advaita or Non-dualism. It breathes the atmosphere of the highest experience of Brahman. It goes into no philosophical argument to prove the oneness of reality but is content to make the most startling statements leaving the seeker of truth to imbibe them and be lifted from illusion into the blazing light of Knowledge.
