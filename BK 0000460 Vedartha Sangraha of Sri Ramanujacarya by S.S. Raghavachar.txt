Sri Ramanuja wrote nine works in Sanskrit on the philosophy of Vishishtadvaita. Of these the Vedartha Samgraha occupies a unique place inasmuch as this work takes the place of a commentary on the Upanishads. The book contains the original Sanskrit text along with a running translation by S. S. Raghavachar and is sure to be useful to all students of Indian philosophy.
