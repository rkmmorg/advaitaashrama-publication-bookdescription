The life of Sri Sarada Devi, popularly known as Holy Mother amongst the devotees, is an enigma. On the surface, it appears to be just a homely life of a Bengali woman mostly in a rural setting. Yet her deportment discloses unmistakable marks of dignity and love of a divine order. Her humility, her touches of serene silence, and the gracious and unbounded richness of her motherly affection, flashes the heavenly splendour of her inner life.

This attractive biographical album containing 177 photographs, includes almost all the available pictures of Holy Mother, individual and in group, and many pictures of places and persons connected with her, arranged chronologically with a life-sketch, write-ups, and quotations.
