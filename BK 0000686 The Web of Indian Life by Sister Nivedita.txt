In this book Sister Nivedita has given us pictures of the Indian woman in her role as mother and wife and as the feeder and sustainer of the national culture and traditions. The author then enters into a study of the national epics, the caste system, and various other aspects of Indian life and ideas, and gives a brilliant sketch of Indian thought and what it stands for. In short, the book is a wonderful account of Hindu society.
