Though many biographies of Vivekananda have been published, this one focuses mainly on his childhood, with glimpses of his growth into a youngster. Swami Vivekananda's personality ? with his courage, selflessness, love for his fellow beings, thirst for knowledge, and other noble qualities?cannot but be a wonderful role model for children even long after they have grown up.
Book Review:
Though many biographies of Vivekananda have been published, this one focuses mainly on his childhood, with glimpses of his growth into a youngster. When one reads this book, one will learn two things about him: First, as a child Naren had many of the experiences that other children have, yet at the same time one can see what an extraordinary individual he was. Second, one will learn how the child Naren was transformed into the personality later known as Swami Vivekananda. Also included is a brief account of Swarniji's accomplishments in his later life, along with his special message to young people.
