<div>The Book contains Sanskrit slokas, its English transliteration, simple meaning in English followed by explanation in English.</div>
Among the several modern commentaries on the Gita, this one is unique in the sense it is both down to earth and fascinatingly erudite. In explaining every verse, the author relates its real connotation and significance to not only what Shankaracharya said in his introduction to the Gita, or how Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda interpreted it in terms of practical Vedanta, but also how it conforms to the thinking of some of the greatest Greek philosophers like <strong>Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle</strong>.

The author takes the readers on an enlightening voyage of discovery, where they meet <strong>Buddha, Mahavir, Tao, Christ</strong> and most of the thinkers in the West and he relates their thought by an ingenious interaction with the message of Sri Krishna. Even scientists like Einstein or the famous neurologist like Charles Sherrington and poets like Wordsworth and Shelley and philosophers like Julian Huxley and Bertrand Russell are brought in by the author to give the readers an in-depth understanding of this great scripture. The author weaves every verse into the requirements of modern life and throws light on how man should lead his life while involved in his daily chores and fulfil his duties in accordance with the philosophy of action as taught by Sri Krishna.
