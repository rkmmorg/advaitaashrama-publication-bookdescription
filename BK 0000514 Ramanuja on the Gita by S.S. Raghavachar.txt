This is an important book written with remarkable ability. The author closely follows Sri Ramanuja's commentary on the Gita. He gives the connection from verse to verse and chapter to chapter and brings out all this in a conspicuous manner. He presents clearly and concretely the comprehensive ideal of the Gita with insight and authority. This book is a distinct contribution to the Gita literature.
