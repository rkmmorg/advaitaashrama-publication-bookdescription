The book presents the fascinating life of Swami Adbhutananda, the only unlettered monastic disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. About him Swami Vivekananda had said: 'Latu is Sri Ramakrishna's greatest miracle. Having absolutely no education, he has attained the highest wisdom simply by virtue of the Master?s touch.? This is the story of his transformation from the orphan boy Latu into a sage, whose profound spirituality inspired Easterners and Westerners alike.
