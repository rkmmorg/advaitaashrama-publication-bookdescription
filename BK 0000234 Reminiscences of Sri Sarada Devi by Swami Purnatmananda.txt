Motherhood is a universal principle pulsating at the root of existence, a mode in which Reality expresses Itself first by creating, and then by preserving and nourishing Its creatures, and finally by receiving all into Its bosom for eternal rest. Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi concretized this principle in her person, and therefore, we see in her personality unique traits of universal character. This book contains twenty-eight inspiring reminiscences of Holy Mother by Monks and lay devotees.
