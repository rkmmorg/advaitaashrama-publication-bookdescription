The Life of Swami Vivekananda Vol - 1 (Deluxe) (Total 2 Volumes).

This book provides the most exhaustive and authentic life of Swami Vivekananda. It provides the most reliable account of a man who not only lived an inspired life but was constantly a source of inspiration to others. Says C. Rajagopalachari: 'Swami Vivekananda saved Hinduism and saved India. But for him, we would have lost our religion and would not have gained our freedom. We therefore owe everything to Swami Vivekananda.?
