This short exposition by Shankaracharya consisting of only eighteen verses is an abridged presentation of his larger Advaitic treatise named Vakya Vritti which has fifty-three verses. In this the author clarifies the meaning and implication of the Mahavakyas the great Vedic sentences dealing with the unity of the individual self and the Supreme Self. It presents its specified theme in a forceful and lucid manner and does not fail to instil in the reader that hope and inspiration which one draws from the other larger work of Shankaracharya.
