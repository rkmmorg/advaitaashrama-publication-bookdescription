The Divine sage Narada declares to the entire humanity through his sublime aphorisms that the immortal Divine Bliss is the birthright of all admonishing the ignorant man to strive for it. The path which he advocates is of divine love and devotion for the Supreme. Sri Ramakrishna too had prescribed the path shown by Narada as the best and the easiest for man to attain God in the present age. The author of this book Swami Bhuteshananda by adding his wonderfully illuminating exposition to these aphorisms has enhanced their value and made it easy for all to comprehend them in the right spirit.
