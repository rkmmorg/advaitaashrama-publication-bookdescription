Impressed by the spiritual mettle of a young monastic disciple named Swami Kalyanananda, Swami Vivekananda once said to him, 'Kalyan, one day you will be a Paramahamsa'. The book contains inspiring reminiscences of this disciple of Swamiji that reveal how he wonderfully exemplified Swamiji's great ideal of service by showing in his own life the immeasurable love, care, sympathy, and self-sacrifice that are required of one who wants to truly serve others.
