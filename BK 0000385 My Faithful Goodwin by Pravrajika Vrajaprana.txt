Swami Vivekananda's sublime message has come down to the world mostly through his extempore addresses. It was Goodwin who took down the words hot from the lips of the great Swami and passed them on to mankind, for which the world will ever remain indebted to him. This book describes how at the touch of the Swami the soul of Goodwin got awakened and he was transformed into an all-sacrificing disciple.
