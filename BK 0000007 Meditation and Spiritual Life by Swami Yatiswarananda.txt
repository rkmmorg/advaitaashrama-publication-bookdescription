'Be bold and face the truth' said Swami Vivekananda. Here is a book that teaches us how to do it. Here is a book for the guidance of sincere spiritual aspirants who have heard the divine call, who have in response to it accepted God-realization as the highest goal of life and who consider no sacrifice too great for the attainment of that goal. It is an invaluable guide to practical spirituality.
