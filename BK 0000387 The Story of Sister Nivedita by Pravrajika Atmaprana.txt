Sister Nivedita s original name was Margaret Elizabeth Noble. She was born on October 28, 1867, at Dungannon, Co. Tyrone, in far-off Ireland. She came from a family called Noble who were of Scottish descent but had been settled in Ireland for about five centuries.
Her father and grandfather lived in very unhappy times. The English had been oppressing the people of Ireland, and they were struggling hard to win freedom for themselves. There were no safety, no security. It is said that Margaret's grand- father, John Noble, was one of the fighters for freedom, and so was her maternal grandfather Hamilton.
