This book contains seven lectures of Swami Vivekananda culled from his Complete Works. It is especially intended for those who have not time enough to go through all the yogas but wish to gain a cursory knowledge of the subject. As the title suggests, the book acquaints the readers with the subject of Self-realisation and its methods in brief.
