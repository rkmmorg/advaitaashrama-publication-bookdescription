This is an elucidative and reconciliatory interpretation of Sri Shankaracharya's life and philosophy. Sri Shankaracharya an exponent of Advaita Vedanta is one of the greatest philosophers of India. He was a brilliant thinker and vigorous debater who reconciled the conflicting sects prevalent in his time and refuted the harmful negative systems of thought thus reviving the Sanatana Dharma and rescuing the foundering Vedic culture. A careful study of his life and philosophy will reveal Shankara's immense contribution to the world thought and dispel the myths and wrong ideas still held about him.
