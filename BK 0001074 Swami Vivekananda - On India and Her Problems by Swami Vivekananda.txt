This book comprises of a compilation from the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda enlightening the readers about the great Swami's views on India and her problems. In Swami Vivekananda India had a son who could feel the very pulse of its life current, its vitality and power. This new Prophet of India could see through the masquerading veil of degeneration and decay, the obscured inherent power of his motherland, in slumber as it were, only waiting to be awakened to take the world by storm. In these pages, the readers will find a penetrating diagnosis of the problems with which India is confronted today, and also its solutions.
