The concept and practice of 'Worship of God as Mother' in India dates to a hoary past.In the modern age, new vistas of this type of divine worship have been opened up with the advent of Sri Ramakrishna whose life and spiritual practices have taught humankind not only to look upon God as a Mother of the Universe but also to realize Her as residing in the hearts of all, especially women.

Evolution Of Mother Worship in India traces the growth of this ideal as embodied in some of it's well-known characters in Indian history and literature.It was first published in 1953, as a third chapter in The Great Women of India, by Prof.Sashi Bhusan Dasgupta, on the Centenary Celebration of Holy Mother's advent.
