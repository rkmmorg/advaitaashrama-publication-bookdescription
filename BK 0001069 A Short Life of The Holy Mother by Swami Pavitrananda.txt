This book is an introduction to the life of Sri Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna.  On account of her immaculate purity, extraordinary forbearance, selfless service, unconditional love, wisdom and spiritual illumination, Swami Vivekananda regarded Sri Sarada Devi as the ideal for women in the modern age. Sister Nivedita stated, “Her life was one long stillness of prayer.”
Endearingly known as ‘Holy Mother’ , her innate motherliness put visiting devotees at ease.  In her opinion devotees of God belonged to a single caste, a spiritual family.
