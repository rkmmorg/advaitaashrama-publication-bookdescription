This is one of the most important works of Sankaracharya on Advaita philosophy. The central theme of the book is the identity of the Jivatman (individual self) and Paramatman (Universal Self). This identity is realized through the removal of the ignorance that hides the truth by the light of enquiry alone. To those who have neither the time nor the opportunity to go through the classical works of Sankaracharya this book will be an invaluable guide in their quest after spiritual truth. This book contains the Sanskrit text with word-for-word translation English rendering and valuable comments.
