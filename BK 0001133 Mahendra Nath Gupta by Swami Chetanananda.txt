That Sri Ramakrishna's inspiring teachings have the quicky spread throughout the world is due in no small part to the immense appeal of 'The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna'. The recorder of this masterpiece, Mahendranath Gupta, remains virtually unknown, as he left scarcely a trace of himself in his work, focusing entirely on the luminous personality of Sri Ramakrishna. This is a biography of this great devotee, the self-effacing author who craved no accolades, whose only mission in life was to spread the life-giving message of his Master.
