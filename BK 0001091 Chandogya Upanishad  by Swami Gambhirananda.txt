Chandogya Upanishad forms the last eight chapters of the Chandogya Brahmana of the Sama Veda. It is the second biggest of the major Upanishads containing sublime flashes of spiritual light which are capable of dispelling our doubts and darkness of ignorance and leading us to a correct understanding of the nature of the Self. No earnest student of Vedanta unable to study this Upanishad in Sanskrit can afford to miss this book for it contains the text in Devanagari a lucid and faithful translation of the text and commentary relevant notes and references to quotations all of which go a long way in helping the reader grasp the sublime theme in an easy manner.
