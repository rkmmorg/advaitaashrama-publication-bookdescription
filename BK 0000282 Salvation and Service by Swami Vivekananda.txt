Even after having stepped into the third millennium characterized by stupendous scientific and technological progress, the world today is witnessing a shocking erosion of ethical and spiritual values all around. In this backdrop a keen need is being felt for combining service with spiritual life, and spiritual life with service, for enriching the quality of both, as an effective panacea for this canker on the world body. This small booklet precisely provides that relieving balm. It is compiled from the numerous inspiring letters penned by Swami Vivekananda. Highly motivating, this book shows us the way to connect the apparently divergent currents of life, Salvation and Service.
