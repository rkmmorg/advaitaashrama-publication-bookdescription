Although this is not a book for the new student of Ramakrishna, it is a highly recommended biography of this great saint. The translation is superb, far superior to the original English translation Ramakrishna: The Great Master. This source biography of Ramakrishna (1836-1886) is based on interviews with those who knew him. It is also an interpreted description of the entire range of Ramakrishna?s spiritual disciplines and experiences, explained as much as possible in terms of reason and common empirical experience, with reference to Hindu scriptures and spiritual traditions, western philosophy, Hindu psychology, and Western religious tradition. The setting is Northeast India from 1775 to 1836.

. . . for experienced meditators this book offers delightful and profound answers to deeper questions about traveling the spiritual path.

. . . for scholars this book offers the source biography for Ramakrishna's life and teachings, as well as an authentic look into India's spiritual history and its various religious and philosophical traditions.
