In these five volumes, comprising the illuminating lectures, writings, articles, books, and epistles etc, of the author, we find the author's marvellous intellect, her lyrical powers of expression, the intensity with which she held her beliefs and convictions, her capacity to see the soul of things straightaway, and above all, her love for India that overflowed all bounds. Her deep study of Indian literature combined with her keen intellect and deep comprehensive mind, helped her to understand India as a whole. This works stands as, perhaps, the best appraisal of India by a western mind.
