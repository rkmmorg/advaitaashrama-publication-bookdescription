In this illuminating book the author traces the decent of the individual from his true divine status to his present condition and describes his ascent back to God. He explains how the various aspects of man's relative existence can be instrumental in the realization of his perfect being which in fact he has never lost. The matter discussed herein is in short an explanation of the involution and evolution of the soul. One finds in these pages the Vedantic answers to many of the big questions that we have asked since we first started asking. It provides not only an intellectual understanding of the soul's journey but also practical counsels on how to speed it along.
