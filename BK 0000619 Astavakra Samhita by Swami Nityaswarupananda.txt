This is a short treatise on Advaita Vedanta ascribed to the great sage Ashtavakra. The teachings of the Ashtavakra Samhita are simple direct in appeal and unhesitating in its delivery. It speaks to the heart and the very reading of it gives even an ordinary person a foretaste of the bliss of freedom. The joy of self-realization is depicted in soul-stirring language which stimulates contemplation.
