This book is a sincere attempt at examining the present situation in the country on some of the major fronts and makes us realize the gross departure of our country’s populace from the ideals Swami Vivekananda placed before us for the making of an “ideal society”. The damaging ideology of materialism has gripped the nation’s soul and infused her with thorough profaneness in every sphere of life. Swami Vivekananda, as a leader of sacred nationhood, is the torch to be lighted in these dismal and dark days that see the erosion of spiritual values in our society.
