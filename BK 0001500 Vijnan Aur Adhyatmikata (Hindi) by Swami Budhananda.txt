Readers will find in this booklet a scientific approach to spirituality incorporating the ideals of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. This book could be particularly helpful for those who find it hard to have faith in spiritual life because of trained scepticism or natural doubts. The author successfully embosses in the minds of the readers that there need not be a clash between science and spirituality in one's life.
