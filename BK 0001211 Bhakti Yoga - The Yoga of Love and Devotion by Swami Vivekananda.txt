Love in its varied aspects is the motive force behind all the actions of living beings. But love takes its highest form when directed towards the God. Among the different paths leading man towards the attainment of the Supreme Truth is the one of love, devotion, and complete surrender. In this book Swami Vivekananda expounds how this path of Bhakti leads man to God. Being an exposition by one of the pioneers in the religious and spiritual realm of the modern times, the value of this work need not be emphasized. Lucid, simple, and to the point, the words of the Swami touch the hearts of the readers and puts them on to the divine path of love supreme.
