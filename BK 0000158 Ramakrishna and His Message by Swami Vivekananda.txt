The reminiscences and profound reflections of Swami Vivekananda concerning his beloved Master are scattered throughout the nine volumes of his Complete Works. To bring them together in one place, as has been done in this book, obviously serves a real need. Swami Vivekananda was the foremost among the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, and what he said about his Master is of great importance, and hence the great value of this book.
