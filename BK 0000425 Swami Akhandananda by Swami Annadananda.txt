The Great Light that was Sri Ramakrishna disappeared from mortal gaze in 1886. But before it went out, other lights had been kindled from that immortal Flame who received the impact of the brilliance of the original and who transmitted his gospel to thousands of their fellow men both at home and abroad. Among these was Swami Akhandananda, who spontaneously responded to the divine call of his inspired teacher. The present book narrates the life story of this great saint in an interesting and yet simple style.
