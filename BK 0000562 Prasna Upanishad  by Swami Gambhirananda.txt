As the name implies this Upanishad discusses philosophical problems through questions and answers between six students and a sage. The questions relate to the source of all beings, the number of deities, the nature of the vital force, the nature of waking, dream and sleep states, meditation on OM and the nature of the highest Reality. To all these questions the sage gives a suitable answer making it easy of comprehension by means of interesting analogies and similes. A lucid and faithful translation of the text along with Shankaracharya's commentary on it will help the students of Vedanta to comprehend this Upanishad in the right spirit.
