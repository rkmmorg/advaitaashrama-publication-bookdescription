Badarayana's Brahma Sutras systematize the teachings of the Upanishads. These along with the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita form the prasthana traya of the spiritual tradition of India. Sri Ramanuja elucidated them in his famous commentary Sri Bhashya from a theistic standpoint. This book contains the original text in Devanagari with English translation and extensive explanatory notes based on Sri BhashyaRamanuja's commentary on the Brahma Sutras as well as his other works Vedanta-sara and Vedanta-Dipa and later glosses on his writings. The introduction contains a comparative study of the commentaries of Shankara Ramanuja Vallabha Nimbarka and Madhava.
