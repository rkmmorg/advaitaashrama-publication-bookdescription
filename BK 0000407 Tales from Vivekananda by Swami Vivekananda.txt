This is an adaptation of a few stories narrated by Swami Vivekananda to his audiences. The stories have been retold giving their imaginary characters familiar names of men and women thus bringing them close to us and making them more intimate living and personal. There is a moral at the end of each tale. With excellent illustrations which further embellish the tales this book is specially meant for children.
